# ICLAB_FinalProject
This is a part of the work for 2023 NTHUEE ICLab final project. Our group built a complete hybrid-crypto system for safe and reliable communication, which merged the symmetric (AES) and asymmetric (ECDH) encryption within a system.

We implemented and verified the algorithm from software to hardware, and, at the end, finished the ASIC design by 45-nm standard-cell library.

This repository collects my contribution to this work. I was responsible for implementing the encrytion and decryption function of <strong>ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange)</strong>. 

Most of the algorithm and structure designs come from the reference paper below:

Stouraitis, "An RNS Implementation of an  $F_{p}$ Elliptic Curve Point Multiplier," in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I: Regular Papers, vol. 56, no. 6, pp. 1202-1213, June 2009, doi: 10.1109/TCSI.2008.2008507.][1]
